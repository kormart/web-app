web-app
=======

A little project


# First
* You need a code editor, for example either of these
    * [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)
    * [Text Mate](http://macromates.com/download) 
* Maybe we need some more tools that will be added here later


# Running local server
* We will use node.js to run a simple web server
* Go to [Node](http://nodejs.org) web page and press Install button and go through the installation steps
* Open terminal window, check that you have the node

    node --version
  
* Create project folder

  mkdir project 
  cd project

* We will use a node library, called Express, that makes it simple to write a web server
* npm is a tool for node.js to install libraries that the node.js uses
* Install Express library (or module)

    npm install express

* Copy the file  server.js in the repo into the project folder and run it

    node server.js

# Web page
* In your project folder, create a folder for web pages

  mkdir public

* We will use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/), which is a framework that simplifies making good looking web pages.
* Download the Bootstrap libraries, by pressing the button on the [Bootstrap page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
* Go into the Mac's Downloads folder, find the Bootstrap folder, on copy the img, js, css folders to your project/public folder
* 

* Copy the file bootstrap_101.html in the repo above to the public folder

# Deploying to cloud
* Get account at Heroku
